## Professional Summary
3+ years as a Backend Engineer — Built Kafka pipeline (150K+ events/day) infra saving $360K/year, and now working @ AWS TimestreamDB on Distributed Systems.

## Professional Experience

### Software Engineer - TimeStream DB Internship
**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** | Sept 2025 - Present
- **Tech Stack**: Java, Distributed Systems, Databases
- Developed and enhanced distributed subsystems for Amazon's time-series database (Timestream), focusing on scalability, performance, and fault tolerance in large-scale production clusters
- Contributed to internal query execution logic and storage layer optimizations, leveraging deep understanding of time-series data workloads

### Software Engineer II - Core Platform Team
**MediBuddy** | Aug 2021 - June 2023
- **Tech Stack**: Java, JavaScript, Apache Kafka, TypeScript, React, Node.js, SQL, Redis, Docker, AWS, Kubernetes
- Led the end-to-end development of a distributed Kafka-based event pipeline processing over 150,000 events per day replacing four legacy services; implemented safe retries, idempotency controls, and structured observability across services, achieving 99.99% system uptime and significantly improving traceability in workflows
- Architected and deployed a high-throughput document ingestion microservice using Java, AWS S3 (pre-signed URLs), and Lambda; scaled to 1,500+ uploads/min under load while reducing backend load by 80% and cutting infrastructure costs by $360,000/year
- Re-engineered monolithic lab booking systems into Redis-backed Node.js microservices, tuning PostgreSQL indexes and SQL joins to reduce booking latency from 4s to 70ms and improve bookings throughput by 200%, directly impacting 70,000+ monthly users
- Led the AngularJS-to-React migration by introducing modular components and optimized build pipelines; improved scalability and maintainability across 1,000+ diagnostic labs, reduced rendering overhead, and delivered a faster, more consistent user experience for customer labs
- Boosted backend API performance by 30% via deep SQL profiling, PostgreSQL query plan analysis, and strategic index optimizations; ensured consistent stability under concurrent requests in high-traffic production environments
- Designed and integrated a comprehensive monitoring and real-time alerting stack using Amazon CloudWatch, Grafana, and log instrumentation; led on-call triage for 30+ P1/P2 production incidents, conducting root-cause analysis and coordinating immediate and long-term fixes

### Research Assistant - CS Dept
**San Francisco State University** | Jan 2025 - Present
- **Tech Stack**: Python, AWS, Vector Databases (Pinecone), OpenAI APIs, LangChain, RAG, Embedding Models
- Designed and deployed a production-grade semantic search engine indexing over 5,000 academic papers using RAG pipelines and Pinecone vector databases; exposed horizontally scalable, GPU-backed APIs supporting sub-second latency for 25+ concurrent users in live test environments
- Built an AI-assisted grading system integrating static analysis, plagiarism detection, and ML-based scoring for automated evaluation of exams, and code; implemented instructor-in-the-loop review workflows, with real-time dashboards for cohort-level learning gaps and grading trends

### Software Engineer - New Projects
**Wheebox** | Aug 2020 - Dec 2020
- **Tech Stack**: Java, Python, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AWS Lambda, RDS, CloudWatch, WebSocket, REST APIs
- Created and deployed a distributed online coding platform in Java (Spring Boot, REST APIs) capable of supporting 1,000+ concurrent users with sub-second feedback latency; optimized request flow, asynchronous execution, and lambdas to sustain real-time assessments under load
- Automated hibernation of idle PostgreSQL RDS instances using AWS Lambda and CloudWatch cron triggers, reducing staging infrastructure costs by approximately $300/month while ensuring resources were automatically reactivated on demand

## Education

### Master of Science - Computer Science
**San Francisco State University** | Aug 2023 - Dec 2025
- **GPA**: 3.60/4.00

## Selected Projects

### Distributed SQL Query Engine
**GitHub**: https://github.com/daivikpurani/distributed-sql-engine
- Designed and implemented a simplified distributed SQL engine in Java with gRPC-based coordinator and execution nodes; supported basic SELECT, WHERE, and JOIN queries across partitioned datasets using parallel execution and rule-based query planning
- Simulated fault tolerance using check pointing and retry logic for failed worker nodes; added instrumentation hooks for tracing query lifecycle, execution trees, and node-level timing to showcase understanding of distributed data processing and optimization internals

### Visual SQL Query Plan Explorer
**GitHub**: https://github.com/daivikpurani/sql-plan-explorer
- Built a web-based visualization tool for PostgreSQL EXPLAIN ANALYZE output, rendering execution plans with operator cost, row estimates, timing data, and bottleneck highlighting; designed for developers and DBAs optimizing large SQL queries
- Implemented a backend parser in Python and interactive React frontend for plan tree navigation, with an "Index Advisor" feature that recommends missing indexes based on query plan heuristics and schema metadata
